                Etiquette is important because it implies polite behavior and helps to build relationships with people whether 
                it is in the workplace or at a party. Etiquette is one way to show respect for other people and to request respect from 
                other people. <br>

                When a person lets go of proper etiquette they often offend other people around them and can lose their job or lose a 
                friendship. Etiquette differs around the world and changes from culture to culture. It can even change slightly from 
                city to city within one country. 
                There are also rules of etiquette when it comes to issues such as plagiarism, 
                copyright infringement, online auctions, graffiti and hacking.

                Etiquette includes an ethical view. It requires people to understand how their actions can affect others and to 
                take responsibility for their actions. One place where etiquette is always necessary is the workplace. 
                Good office etiquette behavior can help a person find success in their field. To practice good office etiquette, 
                a person needs to get to the workplace and all of their scheduled meetings on time. 
                It is disrespectful to other people's time when a person is consistently late. 
                It is also important for people in the workplace to maintain a professional appearance and to use manners as well 
                as their indoor voices when at work for proper etiquette.

                What is Computer Etiquette?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Computer etiquette is the proper way to communicate while interacting with people online. 
                Whether it's done in an email, a chat room, a forum or a blog, 
                there are certain things to keep 
                in mind 
                <img 
                    src="./ComputerEt.png" 
                    alt ="Image of Computer Etiquette"
                    class = "aligen"
                    width="250"

                to ensure that what an individual writes is understood and non-offensive.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One example of computer etiquette is to never use all capital letters. 
                Communicating with someone using all capital letters is akin to yelling at that person, 
                which is considered rude and an inappropriate way to communicate with someone online. 
                It is also important to use proper spelling and punctuation with all online communication, 
                otherwise the writer will appear uneducated and careless, in addition to not getting his or her intended message across.
